# Capture

## A Web Markdown Converter

-----

## About

**Capture** is a web-based Markdown converter. It’s based on John Gruber’s [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), and replicates the functionality of the [Dingus on Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus). It uses JavaScript instead of a the Dingus’s server-side approach to convert Markdown text to HTML.

This is deployed and live at <http://www.swashcap.com/capture>.

## Notes

For me, this is a sort of learning experiment into writing non-jQuery JavaScript, using regular expressions, and employing GitHub. The code is _rough_, so if you have any suggestions please contribute do an issue thingy, a pull request, or whatever.
